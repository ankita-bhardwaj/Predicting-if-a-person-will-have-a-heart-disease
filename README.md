# Predicting-if-a-person-will-have-a-heart-disease

Predicting if a person will have a heart disease in a near future can be very useful to save a lot of lives.
In this project, the data has several independent variables and a variable on which dependent variable was formed.

After running some statistical tests such as t-test and chi-squared test to calculate the p-values of the independent variable with reference to the dependent variable, we found that three features are significant (verified visually as well)

- Age
- Sex
- Maximum heart rate achieved (must be measured while exercising)


By fitting a logistic regression model with the above three independent variables and the dependent variable, 70% accuracy was achieved. Although it may seem not a lot but may be crucial in saving lives.

# This project is done in R.
